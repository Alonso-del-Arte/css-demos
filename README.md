# CSS Demos

In this repository, I will be demonstrating various things that can be done with 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). As such, this repository will contain a lot of 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and CSS, and maybe a little bit of JavaScript.

This project will probably be closed off to Hacktoberfest.
