# CSS Demos

In this repository, I will be demonstrating various things that can be done with 
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). As such, this repository will contain a lot of 
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and CSS, and maybe a little bit of JavaScript.

I started this project using Vim, and will continue using Vim for quick changes. 
But for the most part, I will be using Brackets. For those wishing to fork this 
repository, I recommend using an editor that makes it easy to edit multiple 
files more or less at the same time.

This project will probably be closed off to Hacktoberfest.
